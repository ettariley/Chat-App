# Chat-App

This is a react-native project utilizing expo for testing. Will include basic chat features.
To use, download the project code. If you have expo, then run `expo start` to start the project. You can then use the browser, the Expo iOS app, or the Expo Go Android app (on a physical or virtual device) to preview.
