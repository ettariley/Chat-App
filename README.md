# Chat App

###This is a react-native project utilizing expo for testing.

In this app, you can send text messages, images (from libary or taking a new photo), and your location to a group chat.

To use, download the project code. If you have expo, then run `expo start` to start the project. You can then use the Expo iOS app or the Expo Go Android app (on a physical or virtual device) to preview.
