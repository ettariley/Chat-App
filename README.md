# Chat App

### This is a react-native project utilizing expo for testing.
Messages and images are stored utilizing Firebase Firestore and storage.

In this app, you can send text messages, images (take a new photo or choose from libary), and your location to a group chat.

To use, download the project code. If you have expo, then run `expo start` to start the project. You can then use the Expo iOS app or the Expo Go Android app (on a physical or virtual device) to preview.
